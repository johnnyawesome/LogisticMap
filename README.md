## Description

Chaos! Deterministic chaos! 

The [Logistic Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), which is a Bifurcation Diagram, written in P5JS.

Adjust the starting-values of "r" with an interactive slider!

The diagram bifurcates several times, before it ends in chaos! But... there are stable islands in the chaos. It's absolutely amazing!
